# RT_Information_Leakage
*Investigating Timing-Based Information Leakage in Data Flow-Driven Real-Time Systems*

## Synthetic taskset generation: 

Generate taskset using the script `taskset_generation.py` . This script will generate two separate files for the WCET and period of each task for 100 task sets.

## Demonstration: Manufacturing Robot: 

We demonstrated the existence of information leakage and how attackers can use that information using a manufacturing robot (PiARM from Sunfounder).
